# BeaconHeatMap

This application does two things. Firstly and most importantly it gathers nearby BEKK beacons in
the background and sends them to our storage, for further use in our HeatMap system.

Secondly when opening the application it displays the current nearby BEKK beacons to the user.
This is mostly there for debug purposes when testing the application.
